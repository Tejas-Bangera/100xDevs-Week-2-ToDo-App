# My Todo App

Developed a basic todo `React` app that can create, display your list of todos and delete a specific todo from your list.
As you can see this is not a monorepo, hence to check this project out you have to go to individual folders to run them locally.

## Project Setup and Run

### 1. Clone the project

### 2. Setup & Run the backend

- Go to the `/todo-app-api` directory and follow the steps in the `README` file to **run** the **http server** configured in the todoServer.js file.

### 3. Setup & Run the frontend

- Go to the `/todo-app-client` directory and follow the steps in the `README` file to **run** the **React app**.
